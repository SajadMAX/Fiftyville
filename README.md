# Project Overview
This repository documents my solution to the "Fiftyville Duck Theft Mystery," an SQL-based investigation where I analyzed a database to identify:
1. The thief who stole the CS50 Duck
2. The city the thief escaped to
3. The accomplice who helped the thief escape

This project demonstrates my skills in:
- SQL query writing
- Database analysis
- Logical deduction
- Problem-solving with real-world constraints

# Case Details
-Theft Date: July 28, 2024  
-Location: Humphrey Street, Fiftyville  
# Known Facts:
- The thief stole the duck and shortly afterward took a flight out of town
- The thief had an accomplice who helped them escape

# Database Schema
The investigation used a relational database with the following tables:
- `crime_scene_reports`
- `interviews`
- `atm_transactions`
- `bank_accounts`
- `airports`
- `flights`
- `passengers`
- `phone_calls`
- `people`
- `bakery_security_logs`

Note: Actual table structure may vary based on the specific database provided

# Solution Approach
1. Analyzed crime scene reports for the theft date and location
2. Reviewed witness interviews for clues
3. Tracked financial transactions around the time of theft
4. Investigated flight records leaving Fiftyville after the theft
5. Correlated phone records to identify accomplices
